# Copy on Select Fix

## Problem
Copy on select was not working because:
1. The `selection` property in SwiftTerm is internal/private
2. We couldn't access the selected text directly
3. The `copy(_:)` method alone wasn't sufficient

## Solution
Used the public `getSelection()` method that SwiftTerm provides:
- `getSelection()` returns the selected text as a String? 
- Returns nil if no selection is active
- We can then manually copy this text to the pasteboard

## Implementation

```swift
override func selectionChanged(source: Terminal) {
    super.selectionChanged(source: source)
    
    if copyOnSelect {
        // Small delay to ensure selection is complete
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.1) { [weak self] in
            self?.performCopyIfPossible()
        }
    }
}

private func performCopyIfPossible() {
    // Use the public getSelection() API
    if let selectedText = self.getSelection(), !selectedText.isEmpty {
        let pasteboard = NSPasteboard.general
        pasteboard.clearContents()
        pasteboard.setString(selectedText, forType: .string)
    }
}
```

## How It Works Now

1. When text is selected in the terminal, `selectionChanged` is called
2. If "Copy on Select" is enabled in settings
3. After a 0.1 second delay (to ensure selection is finalized)
4. We call `getSelection()` to get the selected text
5. If text exists, we copy it to the system clipboard

## Testing

1. Enable "Copy on Select" in Terminal Settings â†’ Behavior
2. Save the settings
3. Select any text in the terminal with your mouse
4. The text is automatically copied to clipboard
5. You can paste it anywhere with Cmd+V

## Debug Output

In debug builds, the console will show:
```
Copied to clipboard: [selected text]
```

This confirms the feature is working correctly.
