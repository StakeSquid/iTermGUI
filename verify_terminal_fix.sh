echo "Verifying Terminal Connection Fix"
echo "=================================="
echo ""
echo "The following issues have been fixed:"
echo ""
echo "✅ Issue: 'Terminal not initialized' error when opening new tabs"
echo "   Fix: Removed premature session.connect() call in TerminalSessionManager"
echo "        Connection now happens after terminal view is fully initialized"
echo ""
echo "✅ Issue: SSH connection not established (blinking cursor)"  
echo "   Fix: Terminal properly stores reference before connecting"
echo "        Added small delay to ensure terminal is ready before SSH connection"
echo ""
echo "Changes made:"
echo "1. TerminalSessionManager.swift line 30: Removed automatic connect() on session creation"
echo "2. EmbeddedTerminalView.swift line 302-306: Added delay before connecting to ensure terminal is ready"
echo ""
echo "How to test:"
echo "1. Run the application: ./.build/debug/iTermGUI"
echo "2. Create or select an SSH profile with valid connection details"
echo "3. Click on 'Embedded Terminal' tab"
echo "4. Click the '+' button to create a new terminal tab"
echo ""
echo "Expected behavior:"
echo "- Terminal should connect successfully without errors"
echo "- SSH session should be established and prompt should appear"
echo "- Multiple tabs should work independently"
echo "- No 'Terminal not initialized' errors"
echo ""
echo "If you still see connection issues, check:"
echo "- SSH profile has correct host/username/port"
echo "- SSH key path is valid (if using key authentication)"
echo "- Target server is accessible from your machine"
