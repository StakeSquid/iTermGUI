# iTerm2 SSH Profile Manager - Project Plan

## Overview
A macOS GUI application that manages SSH profiles for iTerm2, allowing users to create, organize, and connect to SSH hosts with a seamless interface.

## Core Features

### Profile Management
- Create, edit, delete SSH profiles with intuitive UI
- Import SSH configs from ~/.ssh/config
- Import from custom directories
- Export profiles to standard SSH config format
- Profile templates for quick setup

### Connection Features
- One-click connect to SSH hosts via iTerm2
- Support for SSH key authentication
- Password management with Keychain integration
- SSH tunneling and port forwarding configuration
- Jump host/bastion support

### Organization
- Group profiles by categories (Work, Personal, Projects)
- Tag system for flexible organization
- Search and filter profiles
- Favorites/starred profiles for quick access
- Recent connections history

### iTerm2 Integration
- Dynamic profiles generation
- Custom color schemes per profile
- Terminal settings per profile (font, size, cursor)
- Window/tab arrangement presets
- Send text at start (initial commands)

## Advanced Features

### Security & Authentication
- Biometric authentication (Touch ID/Face ID) for sensitive profiles
- SSH key generation and management
- Certificate-based authentication support
- Two-factor authentication support
- Encrypted profile storage

### Automation & Productivity
- Batch operations (connect to multiple hosts)
- Profile synchronization via iCloud
- Command snippets library per profile
- Auto-reconnect on disconnect
- Session recording and playback

### Monitoring & Management
- Connection status monitoring
- Network latency indicators
- Session logging with searchable history
- Resource usage per connection
- Notification system for connection events

### Import/Export Capabilities
- Import from popular SSH clients (PuTTY, SecureCRT)
- Import from cloud providers (AWS EC2, Azure, GCP)
- Export to various formats (JSON, YAML, XML)
- Backup and restore functionality
- Profile sharing via URL schemes

### User Experience
- Quick connect via global hotkey
- Menu bar integration for quick access
- Spotlight/Alfred integration
- Dark/Light mode support
- Customizable keyboard shortcuts

## Technical Implementation

### iTerm2 Integration Methods
- Dynamic Profiles API (JSON-based configuration)
- AppleScript automation for advanced control
- URL schemes (iterm2://profile=name)
- Python API for scriptable actions

### Technology Stack
- **Primary**: SwiftUI for native macOS experience
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI with AppKit bridges where needed
- **Data Storage**: Core Data for profile management
- **Security**: Keychain Services for credential storage
- **Networking**: Network framework for connection testing

## Implementation Milestones

### Phase 1: MVP (Weeks 1-4)
- Basic profile CRUD operations
- Import from ~/.ssh/config
- Simple iTerm2 profile generation
- Basic UI with list/detail view

### Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 5-8)
- Group and tag management
- Search and filtering
- iTerm2 advanced settings
- Keychain integration

### Phase 3: Enhanced UX (Weeks 9-12)
- Menu bar app
- Global hotkeys
- Profile templates
- Recent connections

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Weeks 13-16)
- iCloud sync
- Import/export formats
- Session management
- Monitoring capabilities

## Additional Feature Ideas

### Developer-Focused
- Git repository integration (auto-detect project SSH configs)
- Docker container SSH management
- Kubernetes pod access shortcuts
- VS Code Remote SSH integration
- Ansible inventory import

### Enterprise Features
- LDAP/Active Directory integration
- Compliance and audit logging
- Role-based access control
- Centralized profile management
- Team profile sharing

### Quality of Life
- Profile health checks (test connections)
- Automatic SSH config backup
- Profile migration assistant
- Connection speed optimization
- Smart suggestions based on usage patterns
