## üîß Advanced Features

### Server-to-Server Transfers
Transfer files directly between servers without downloading to your Mac:
1. Open SFTP window
2. Connect left pane to Server A
3. Connect right pane to Server B
4. Select files/folders and transfer directly
5. Data streams through your Mac via SSH tunnel (not saved locally)

### Handling SSH Config Wildcards
For SSH config entries with wildcards like:
```
Host rpc-br-*
    HostName %h.stakesquid.eu
    User root
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/stakesquid
```
Just use the base hostname (e.g., `rpc-br-5`) to avoid domain duplication.

### Batch Operations
- Select multiple profiles with `‚åò+Click`
- Connect to all simultaneously
- Choose tabs or separate windows
- Apply settings to multiple profiles at once

### Profile Templates
1. Set up a profile with common settings
2. Save as global defaults via Preferences
3. All new profiles inherit these settings
4. Apply defaults to existing profiles in bulk

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"iTermGUI can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer"**
- Right-click the app and select "Open"
- Or go to System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí "Open Anyway"

**SSH connection fails**
- Verify credentials and network connectivity
- Check SSH key permissions (should be 600)
- Ensure jump host configuration is correct
- For wildcard hosts, use base hostname only

**SFTP transfer fails**
- Check the error details in the transfer queue (click info button)
- Common issues:
  - File/folder doesn't exist: Verify paths
  - Permission denied: Check read/write permissions
  - Tilde expansion: Paths like `~/.ssh` are now properly handled
  - Directory transfers: Folders are now supported with recursive copying

**Profiles not syncing with iTerm2**
- Ensure iTerm2 is running
- Check Dynamic Profiles: `~/Library/Application Support/iTerm2/DynamicProfiles/`
- Restart iTerm2 if needed

### Debug Mode
Run from terminal to see debug output:
```bash
/Applications/iTermGUI.app/Contents/MacOS/iTermGUI
```

### Data Storage Locations
- **Profiles**: `~/Documents/iTermGUI/profiles.json`
- **Groups**: `~/Documents/iTermGUI/groups.json`  
- **Defaults**: `~/Documents/iTermGUI/defaults.json`
- **Passwords**: macOS Keychain (secure)
- **iTerm2 Profiles**: `~/Library/Application Support/iTerm2/DynamicProfiles/`
